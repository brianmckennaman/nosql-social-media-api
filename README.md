# nosql-social-media-api

The goal of this assignment was to created a social media backend API using MongoDB.

First, I created a user and a thought model to dictate the structure of the data. 

Then, I created controllers for the users and thoughts to allow CRUD operations, as well as adding the ability to add reactions to thoughts using a seperate schema and the ability to add friends to a user. A virtual to count up the total number of friends for a user and the total number of reactions for a thought were also added.

Finally, I created routes allowing the data to be accessed using backend tester Insomnia.
